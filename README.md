# FRED Documentation

This documentation aids the users of the [Free Registry for ENUM and 
Domains](https://fred.nic.cz), the domain name registry software
developed by the CZ.NIC.

The documentation is divided into 3 publications:

* Features,
* Architecture description,
* Administration manual.

## Under construction

The publications are currently in development by the CZ.NIC.

The first version of these publications is planned to be completed by the end
of this year (2016). 
After that, the project will be open for contributions (pull requests).

## Future plans

The documentation will be later extended with these additional publications:

* FRED-client user guide,
* Custom EPP-client implementation guide,
* WebAdmin user guide.
