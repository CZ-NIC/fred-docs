Installation from source RPMs
-----------------------------

We also provide SRPM packages for a rebuild with the RedHat package manager.

You can download them from http://archive.nic.cz/yum/fred/SRPMS/

.. Note:: You have to rebuild and install the :file:`fred-idl`
   and :file:`fred-distutils` packages first.

.. Important:: Remember to :ref:`set the timezone in PostgreSQL <set-pg>`
   to ``UTC``.
