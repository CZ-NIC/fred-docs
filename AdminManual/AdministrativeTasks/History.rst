Viewing history
---------------

The WebAdmin allows you to view the history of registrable objects.
The history of object's values is displayed together with object's details.
The display of history is turned on by checking the :guilabel:`History` checkbox
in the top right area of the screen. You can turn it off by unchecking the checkbox.
The setting is applied to the whole session, so you do not have to check it
for every object you visit.
