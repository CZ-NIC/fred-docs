This chapter will give you hints on how the typical administrative tasks are done.

While some can be performed using the web administration application (WebAdmin),
and we will guide you to the respective screen for each task, others must be
executed with other administration utilities.

To use the WebAdmin, you have to log in.

If the WebAdmin is not providing some functionality described here,
check the permissions of the user under which you login.
