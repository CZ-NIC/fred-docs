Extensions
======================

The FRED has some extensions.

MojeID
------

MojeID is an implementation of a family of authentication protocols and
a register of user identities that together allow the authentication
of users for third-party services.
The identities are based on FRED contact objects.


Domain Browser
--------------

Domain Browser is a web application that allows authenticated users to display
data from the domain registry to which a user is related as a contact.
It uses the MojeID service for user authentication.
