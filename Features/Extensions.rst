.. _FRED-Features-Extensions:

Extending features :sup:`CZ-specific`
=====================================

The FRED functionality is enriched by some extensions.

.. Note:: So far, these extensions are specific to the Czech Registry.

MojeID
------

`MojeID <https://www.mojeid.cz/>`_
is an implementation of a family of authentication protocols and
a register of user identities that together allow the authentication
of users for third-party services.
The identities are based on FRED contact objects.


Domain Browser
--------------

`Domain Browser <https://www.domenovyprohlizec.cz/>`_
is a web application that allows authenticated users to display
data from the domain register to which a user is related as a contact.
It uses the MojeID service for user authentication.
