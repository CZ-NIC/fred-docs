Whois
-----

There are two versions of the WHOIS service. 

The first version is a classical Unix WHOIS service as specified 
in `RFC 1834 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1834>`_. 
This service features recursive results for all associated objects
and inverse queries. 

The second version is a `web WHOIS application <https://www.nic.cz/whois/>`_.
The web version supports hyperlinked and more detailed results.
There is even a possibility to enable CAPTCHA protection against robots.

Both versions contain the security feature of hiding personal data of contacts.
