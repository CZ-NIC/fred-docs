   .. struct-end

The main goal of the FRED is to administer authoritative information
on domains, domain ownership and owners which is then distributed via the DNS
(zone file) as well as served in response to public queries (whois).
To accomplish this, the system allows to input the relevant information into
its database through the registration process and comprises the means
to administrate existing data.

The relevant information obtained by the registration process is grouped
into so-called **registrable objects**.

To ensure the authenticity of the data, only authorized entities (registrars)
can perform registrations and modify existing data in the Registry.
