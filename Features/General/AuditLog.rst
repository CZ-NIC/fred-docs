Audit log
---------

FRED creates an audit trail of activity of all user services
(EPP, WHOIS, RDAP, WebAdmin). Log records include user names and IP addresses,
from which service requests come.

An audit trail is required as the basis for information security audits and
it can also serve as a supporting mechanism for access control, prevention
of criminal activity, evidence in a trial, or just an auxiliary tool in problem
solving.

The specialized schema of the log database allows the records to be maintained
month by month.
