Object locking
--------------

Object locking stands for enhanced security settings of registrable objects
that a registrant can request from the Registry directly.

To submit a request to lock an object, a registrant uses the "Public Request"
website form. However, an extra electronically signed email or
an officially signed letter must follow to confirm that the registrant is
authorized for such request.

The request is processed manually by Registry staff after verifying
the authorization.

To unlock an object, the process is the same.
