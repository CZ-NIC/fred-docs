Contact verification :sup:`$CZ-specific$`
-----------------------------------------

There is a method to minimize occurrence of fake contact data by performing
checks on random contacts.

The chosen contact undergoes an automatic check, first,
which verifies the formal syntax of the data and tries to find
the address in the street register.

In case of problems, the contact is handed over for a manual check
by Registry staff that tries to communicate with the contact.

If there is no response, the contact and its domains are deleted.
