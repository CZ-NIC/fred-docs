Multi-language support
----------------------

The FRED is UTF8-aware within all its subsystems.
Supported languages are very easily extensible by means of a standard process
of language-catalogues manipulation.
Internationalized Domain Names (IDN) are supported in the system core
although they are not used by any Registry operating FRED at the moment.

   .. Note:: Domains in UTF-8 can be registered and displayed
      but similarly-looking characters can pose potential problems
      since there is no way of restricting the applicable character set.
