GDPR compliance
---------------

:term:`GDPR` is an EU regulation, which must be complied with, once the Registry
operator deals with personal information of natural persons
that are based in the EU.

The FRED has adapted its policies to hide most of the personal information
and it does not share personal information
with third-party entities (especially the public via FRED's public interfaces)
without explicit consent from end users (natural persons),
with the exception of name, organization, and, if a contact is not verified, address.

The consent for disclosure of some contact information can be given
as disclosure preference flags through the EPP.
(See :doc:`/EPPReference/PoliciesRules` for details.)

End users (natural persons) may place a \ :term:`public request` any time
to find out what personal information is stored in the Registry about them.
