DNSSEC support
--------------

The `DNS Security Extensions <http://www.dnssec.net/>`_
are supported by the FRED out-of-the-box.

The software supports creating, storing and manipulating DNSSEC records
in the Registry while leaving the zone-signing process to external tools.
It gives the Registry operator the flexibility to choose any suitable
DNSSEC tools to meet the desired security and performance.
