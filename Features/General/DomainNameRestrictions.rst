Domain name restrictions
------------------------

The FRED contains a mechanism that allows the Registry administrator to restrict
registered domain names by providing forbidden keywords or patterns
in the domain blacklist.

The :ref:`restrictions can be configured <restrict-dn>` for any period of time
given by a starting and ending date of validity.
