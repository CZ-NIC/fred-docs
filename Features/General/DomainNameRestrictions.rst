Domain name restrictions & handle formats
-----------------------------------------

The FRED contains a mechanism that allows the Registry operator to restrict
registered domain names by providing forbidden keywords or patterns
in the domain blacklist.

The :ref:`restrictions can be configured <config-restrict-dn>` for any period
of time given by a starting and ending date of validity.

Similarly, the Registry operator can :ref:`configure the format of handles
<config-handles>` of contacts, nssets and keysets, and they can do it for each
object type separately.
