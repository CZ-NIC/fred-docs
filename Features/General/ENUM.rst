ENUM
----

A standard protocol for electronic mapping of phone numbers to domains
which allows to associate an IP phone with a classic phone number
and store these phone number domains in DNS.

In comparison to regular domains, ENUM domains have an additional attribute,
the validation expiration date, as a means of verification of number ownership.

ENUM is defined in  `RFC 3761 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3761>`_.
