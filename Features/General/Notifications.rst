Notifications
-------------

The Registrars and Registrants are notified about important situations
in the Registry.

The Registrars are notified using the EPP mechanism of poll messages.
The Registrants are notified using email. Emails are constructed
from predefined configurable templates. All outgoing emails are stored
in a searchable archive. The email messages produced by the system comply
with the `RFC 2387 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2387>`_ standard.

Notification conditions include domain expiration, domain disabling,
domain unregistration or any object modification using EPP.

All time periods for domain disabling and unregistration are configurable.
