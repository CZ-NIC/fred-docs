Generation of verified record statements
----------------------------------------

A record statement is a generated confirmation of a state of a registrable
object in a certain moment. The statement can be used as legal evidence
of ownership for the police or in court. It is a PDF document signed
with an official digital signature.

If a statement is requested through the public interface (web whois),
some contact information will be hidden according to disclosure settings
of that contact. A statement can be also issued privately through the Domain
Browser and in that case all contact information is disclosed in the statement.
