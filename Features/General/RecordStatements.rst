Generation of verified record statements
----------------------------------------

A record statement is a generated confirmation of a state of a registrable
object in a certain moment (current or historical). The statement can be used
as legal evidence for the police or in court. It is a PDF document signed
with an official digital signature.

If a statement is requested through the public interface (web whois),
some contact information will be hidden according to disclosure settings
of that contact. A statement can be also issued privately through the administration
interface (Daphne) or Domain Browser and in those cases all contact information
is disclosed in the statement.
