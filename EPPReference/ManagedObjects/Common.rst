Common object attributes
------------------------

Each managed object has the following attributes:

``ROID``
   Repository object identifier as :term:`eppcom:roidType`.
   An id that is generated by the server during object creation.
   See also :term:`ROID`.

``clID``
   The handle of the current designated registrar as :term:`eppcom:clIDType`.

``crID``
   The handle of the registrar who created this object as :term:`eppcom:clIDType`.

``upID``
   The handle of the registrar who was the last to update this object
   as :term:`eppcom:clIDType`.

``crDate``
   The :ref:`timestamp <mngobj-timestamps>` of the creation of this
   object in the repository as :term:`xs:dateTime`.

``upDate``
   The :ref:`timestamp <mngobj-timestamps>` of the last update
   of this object as :term:`xs:dateTime`.

``trDate``
   The :ref:`timestamp <mngobj-timestamps>` of the last transfer
   of this object as :term:`xs:dateTime`.

``authInfo``
   Authorization information (transfer password) as :term:`fredcom:authInfoType`.

``status``
   Current object status(es) (possible values are object-specific).

   Statuses are set by the server and cannot be directly altered by a client.

   An object can have one or more statuses but they can appear only in certain
   combinations which are not contradictory.

.. _mngobj-domain-syntax:

Domain names and hostnames
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A domain name being registered or a name-server hostname being assigned to an nsset
must be in the :term:`FQDN` form.

A domain name or a hostname must comply with the following syntax:

* it may contain only characters [a-z,A-Z,0-9], hyphen ``-`` (`U+002D
  <http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/2d/index.htm>`_),
  and dot ``.`` as the delimiter of labels,

  .. Note:: The capitalization of letters is irrelevant, the server converts
     upper-case letters to their lower-case variant.

* it may end with a dot,
* its labels must not begin nor end with a hyphen ``-``,
* its labels must have the length of 1–63 characters,
* its total length (including dot delimiters) must not exceed 255 characters.

Labels of ENUM domains must be single decimal digits.

A domain name must belong to one of the zones which are managed by the Registry,
that is, it must end with the FQDN of one of those zones.

Additional CZ.NIC rules for domain names:

* their labels must not contain two consecutive hyphens ``--`` (IDN not allowed),
* the number of allowed labels:
   * 2 labels in a FQDN in the case of the ``.cz`` zone, and
   * 6–15 labels in a FQDN in the case of the ``.0.2.4.e164.arpa`` ENUM zone.

.. Note::

   Validation of the format of domain names may be configured by the Registry
   operator differently. The Registry operator is supposed to publish
   a document that declares the rules of registrar communication with the Registry,
   including a definition of valid domain names.

.. _mngobj-handle-syntax:

Handles of contacts, nssets and keysets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A handle may contain only characters [a-z,A-Z,0-9] and hyphen ``-`` (`U+002D
<http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/2d/index.htm>`_) which must
not appear at the beginning or the end of the handle.

.. Note:: The capitalization of letters is irrelevant, the server converts
   lower-case letters to their upper-case variant.

The length of a handle that is an argument to a ``create`` command, must not
exceed 30 characters (:term:`fredcom:objIDCreateType`), in other cases,
a handle may be up to 63 characters long (:term:`fredcom:objIDType`
or :term:`fredcom:objIDChgType`).

.. Note::

   Validation of the format of handles may be configured by the Registry
   operator differently. The Registry operator is supposed to publish
   a document that declares the rules of registrar communication with the Registry,
   including a definition of valid handles.

.. _mngobj-timestamps:

Timestamps
^^^^^^^^^^

Timestamps are provided in local time of the FRED EPP server with an offset
from UTC in compliance with :rfc:`3339` and :term:`xs:dateTime` syntax.
