Common object attributes
------------------------

Each managed object has the following attributes:

``ROID``
   Repository object identifier as :term:`eppcom:roidType`.
   An id that is generated by the server during object creation.
   See also :term:`ROID`.

``clID``
   The handle of the current designated registrar as :term:`eppcom:clIDType`.

``crID``
   The handle of the registrar who created this object as :term:`eppcom:clIDType`.

``upID``
   The handle of the registrar who was the last to update this object
   as :term:`eppcom:clIDType`.

``crDate``
   The :ref:`timestamp <mngobj-timestamps>` of the creation of this
   object in the repository as :term:`xs:dateTime`.

``upDate``
   The :ref:`timestamp <mngobj-timestamps>` of the last update
   of this object as :term:`xs:dateTime`.

``trDate``
   The :ref:`timestamp <mngobj-timestamps>` of the last transfer
   of this object as :term:`xs:dateTime`.

``authInfo``
   Authorization information (transfer password) as :term:`fredcom:authInfoType`.

``status``
   Current object status(es) (possible values are object-specific).

   Statuses are set by the server and cannot be directly altered by a client.

   An object can have one or more statuses but they can appear only in certain
   combinations which are not contradictory.

.. _mngobj-domain-syntax:

Domain names and hostnames
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A domain name being registered or a name-server hostname being assigned to an nsset
must be in the :term:`FQDN` form and must comply with restrictions as follows.

.. rubric:: Regular domain names (e.g. in the ``cz`` zone)

* are composed of 2 labels separated with a period ``.``,
* the first label
   * contains only upper-case and lower-case letters of the English alphabet,
     digits (characters 0 through 9), and ``-`` [#hyph]_ characters,
   * does not begin nor end with the ``-`` [#hyph]_ character,
   * does not contain two or more consecutive ``-`` [#hyph]_ characters,
   * has the length of 1–63 characters,
* the second label is a TLD zone (e.g. ``cz``),
* may end with a period.

The register is case-insensitive and presents the domain names transformed to lower case.

.. rubric:: ENUM domain names (e.g. in the ``0.2.4.e164.arpa`` zone)

* are composed of 6–15 labels separated with a period ``.``,
* each label preceeding the zone contains exactly one digit (characters 0 through 9),
* ends with a Tier1 ENUM zone (e.g. ``0.2.4.e164.arpa``),
* may end with a period.

The register is case-insensitive and presents the domain names transformed to lower case.

.. Note::

   Validation of the format of domain names may be configured by the Registry
   operator differently. The Registry operator is supposed to publish
   a document that declares the rules of registrar communication with the Registry,
   including a definition of valid domain names.

.. rubric:: Hostnames

* are composed of labels separated with periods ``.``,
* labels
   * contain only upper-case and lower-case letters of the English alphabet,
     digits (characters 0 through 9), and ``-`` [#hyph]_ characters,
   * do not begin nor end with the ``-`` [#hyph]_ character,
   * have the length of 1–63 characters,
* may end with a period,
* must not exceed the total length of 255 characters
  (including delimiter periods and the final period).

.. _mngobj-handle-syntax:

Handles of contacts, nssets and keysets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Handles of contacts, name-server sets and key sets:

* contain only upper-case and/or lower-case letters of the English alphabet,
  digits (characters 0 through 9), and ``-`` [#hyph]_ characters,
* do not begin nor end with the \ ``-`` [#hyph]_ character,
* do not exceed the length of 30 [#length]_ characters.

The register is case-insensitive and presents the identifiers transformed to upper case.

.. [#hyph] the character of the basic ASCII set for hyphen/minus

.. [#length] The length of a handle that is an argument to a ``create`` command,
   must not exceed 30 characters (:term:`fredcom:objIDCreateType`),
   in other cases, a handle may be up to 63 characters long
   (:term:`fredcom:objIDType` or :term:`fredcom:objIDChgType`).

.. Note::

   Validation of the format of handles may be configured by the Registry
   operator differently. The Registry operator is supposed to publish
   a document that declares the rules of registrar communication with the Registry,
   including a definition of valid handles.

.. _mngobj-timestamps:

Timestamps
^^^^^^^^^^

Timestamps are provided in local time of the FRED EPP server with an offset
from UTC in compliance with :rfc:`3339` and :term:`xs:dateTime` syntax.
