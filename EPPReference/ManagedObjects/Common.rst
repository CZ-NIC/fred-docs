Common object attributes
------------------------

Each managed object has the following attributes:

ROID
   Repository object identifier as :term:`eppcom:roidType`.
   An id that is generated by the server during object creation.

   This id should uniquely identify the object world-wide. It is composed
   of two parts separated with a hyphen. The first part is unique within the
   repository and defined by the Registry. The second part must be unique
   world-wide, it is assigned for the whole repository by the IANA organization.

clID
   The handle of the current designated registrar as :term:`eppcom:clIDType`.

crID
   The handle of the registrar who created this object as :term:`eppcom:clIDType`.

upID
   The handle of the registrar who was the last to update this object as :term:`eppcom:clIDType`.

crDate
   Date and time of the creation of this object in the repository as :term:`xs:dateTime`.

upDate
   Date and time of the last update of this object as :term:`xs:dateTime`.

trDate
   Date and time of the last transfer of this object as :term:`xs:dateTime`.

authInfo
   Authorization information (transfer password) as :term:`fredcom:authInfoType`.

status
   Current object status (possible values are object-specific).

   Statuses are set by the server and can not be altered by a client.

.. _mngobj-domain-syntax:

Domain names and hostnames
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A domain name being registered or a nameserver hostname being assigned to a nsset
must be in the :term:`FQDN` form.

A domain name or a hostname must comply with the following syntax:

* it may contain only characters [a-z,0-9], hyphen ``-`` (`U+002D
  <http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/2d/index.htm>`_),
  and dot ``.`` as the delimiter of labels,
* it may end with a dot,
* its labels must not begin nor end with a hyphen ``-``,
* its labels must have the length of 1–63 characters,
* its total length (including dot delimiters) must not exceed 255 characters.

A domain name must belong to one of the zones that is managed by the Registry,
that is, it must end with the FQDN of one of these zones.

Additional CZ.NIC rules for domain names:

* their labels must not contain two consecutive hyphens ``--`` (IDN not allowed),
* the number of allowed labels:
   * 2 labels in the FQDN in the case of the ``.cz`` zone, and
   * 6–15 labels in the FQDN in the case of the ``.0.2.4.e164.arpa`` ENUM zone.

.. _mngobj-handle-syntax:

Handles of contacts, nssets and keysets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A handle may contain only characters [a-z,A-Z,0-9] and hyphen ``-`` (`U+002D
<http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/2d/index.htm>`_) which must
not appear at the beginning or the end of the handle.

The capitalization of letters is irrelevant, the server converts lower-case letters to upper case.

The length of a new handle must not exceed 30 characters (:term:`fredcom:objIDCreateType`)
but an older handle may be up to 63 characters long (:term:`fredcom:objIDType`
or :term:`fredcom:objIDChgType`).
