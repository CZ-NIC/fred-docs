   Registrable object
      A data object stored in the Registry that can be registered and modified
      by registrars. There are four types: domains, contacts, nssets, and keysets.

      They are also called *managed objects* in the EPP.

   Registrant
      Registrant is the contact which is assigned as the domain owner;
      also called the holder.

   ROID

      of a registrable object.

      of two parts separated with a hyphen, e.g. ``D0010123116-CZ``.
      The first part is unique within the Registry and is defined by the Registry.
      The second part (Repository id suffix) must be unique world-wide and
      it is assigned to the Registry by `IANA organization
